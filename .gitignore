**Step 2: Reset Your Git Configuration and Push Correctly**

Now that we've told Git what to ignore, let's fix the address and do a clean upload.

1.  Open a new terminal in VS Code, making sure you are in the main `strangerhub` folder.
2.  Copy and paste the following commands one by one, pressing **Enter** after each.

    ```bash
    # This removes the old, incorrect repository address
    git remote remove origin
    ```
    Now, go to your repository page on GitHub. Click the green "<> Code" button and make sure "HTTPS" is selected. **Copy the URL from there.** It should look like `https://github.com/prathamji02/strangerhub-app.git`.
    

    ```bash
    # Add the correct repository address (replace the URL with the one you just copied)
    git remote add origin https://github.com/prathamji02/strangerhub-app.git
    ```
    ```bash
    # This stages all the correct files, ignoring node_modules
    git add .
    ```
    ```bash
    # Commit the changes
    git commit -m "Final version before deployment"
    ```
    ```bash
    # Finally, push your code to GitHub
    git push -u origin main
