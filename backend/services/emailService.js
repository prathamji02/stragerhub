            <h2>Hi ${userName},</h2>
            <p>Welcome to IPU Friendlist! Your account has been created, and we're excited for you to join our exclusive community at GTBIT.</p>
            
            <h3>Your First Login</h3>
            <p>You may now proceed to log in. On your first login, you will be prompted to create your permanent, anonymous alias (your "fake name"). This is how others will see you, so choose wisely!</p>
            
            <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">How It Works</h3>
            <p>From now on, you can chat with random, verified strangers from within your campus. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be Respectful:</strong> At the end of each chat, both users will rate each other. Your average public rating will be visible to everyone, helping to build a safe and trustworthy community.</li>
                <li><strong>Make a Connection:</strong> If you find someone who matches your vibe, send them a "Connect" request. If they accept, a private chatroom will be created where you can continue the conversation anytime.</li>
                <li><strong>You're in Control:</strong> Any saved chatroom can be permanently deleted by either person at any time.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We can't wait to see the connections you'll make.</p>
            <p>Best,<br/>The IPU Friendlist Team</p>
